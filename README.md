# Fancy Photo Grid

Thanks for checking out this repo. It's nothing too exciting, at least not yet. I wanted to try out AngularJS, so I started a project to show and allow for filtering of photos. I'm not really sure what the end product is going to be, but for now just a way to try out AngularJS.

Check out the [demo](http://fancyphotogrid.derrickshowers.com).

### v0.1
*10/27/13*

* Added Bootstrap 3.0 for presentation purposes.
* Hardcoded JSON object contains a list of photos - contains src, description, id, location and date.
* Filter allows the user to type a keyword and the grid will dynamically update.
* Using [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) for setup.
